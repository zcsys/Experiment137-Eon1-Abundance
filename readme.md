### Eon 1: Abundance
(Nov 23, 2024 - *ongoing*)

#### Era 0: 270 Balls
* nn2: Simple feed-forward network with 2 hidden layers using ReLU, where the
			 first hidden layer has 4x expansion from the input layer, and the second
			 hidden layer is either of the size of the input layer or 2x the size of
			 the output layer, whichever is larger, finally transformed into the
			 output layer with tanh
* Monads controlled by an nn2

							 and 80 hidden neurons, governed by 2281 parameters
	* Monad7A217: Monad with 16 input, 9 output, 16 memory, and 160 hidden
							  neurons, governed by 9177 parameters - LMWS and messaging
							  neurons are removed; ability to sense the resource gradient and
								to apply force on the resource grid are added
  * Monad7B105: Monad7A217 minus memory (down to 2k parameters; faster not
								step-wise but learning-wise)
